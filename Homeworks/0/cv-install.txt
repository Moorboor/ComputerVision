Setup your homework environment
===============================

This guide will help you install conda and create the cv conda
environment required for following the practice session. If you have
an up to date conda version installed you can skip the first step. (To
update conda run 'conda update anaconda' or if you have miniconda
installed 'conda update conda'.)

a) Install Conda
----------------

Practice session and assignments will use Jupyter notebooks, which
requires Python. Moreover, we need additional Computer Vision
packages.

They are best managed with Conda:

We recommend miniconda which you can install from here: 
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html 

Alternatively download and install Anaconda which is larger and comes with more
preinstalled packages.
https://www.anaconda.com/download

You can find installation instructions here:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

b) Setup the cv environment
----------------------------

Download cv.yml from StudIP. Then in a terminal navigate to the
directory where you saved cv.yml and run

    'conda env create -f cv.yml' 


c) Activate the environment
---------------------------

Always activate the environment when you work on the homework:

    'conda activate cv'

To deactivate an environment:

    'conda deactivate'


d) Run Jupyter Notebooks
------------------------

After you installed Python and the cv environment verify you are able
to run the notebook server by opening your command line

  jupyter notebook
  
Usually a browser window should open up. If not, open your favorite
webbrowser and navigate to localhost:8888/tree.


e) Documentation
